This was developed in PyCharm, so all the dependencies are included in the file.  The python files that we wrote are
directly in the venv folder, and the resources are (creatively) in the resources folder under venv.

Controls for the game:
Use WASD to move forward, left, back, and right respectively, and the left and right arrow keys turn you left and right.
The sounds you hear are echos of your footsteps off the walls to your left and right to help you know where you are.  You
can also stomp your foot by pressing space.  If you can't tell where you are, you can toggle the map with "b".  You can
also toggle the footstep sound effect with "v".  There is no victory condition so far.
